## File Description

This repository contains all scripts required to reproduce the simulation and numerical results presented in the article.
 | File Name       | Description      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `hybrid_GEO_PO.m` | This file contains the code for the GEO, PO, and hybrid GEO_PO algorithms developed to optimize the PI controller gains of the dual-input charger designed to charge the EV battery |
| `Dual_Boost_71V_GEO_PO.slx` | This file depicts the MATLAB/SIMULINK block diagram of the developed charger with the controller mechanism employed, as shown in Fig. 6 of the manuscript |

## Instruction to run the program 
Both the `hybrid_GEO_PO.m` file and `Dual_Boost_71V_GEO_PO.slx` file should be in the same folder as the program file calls the simulation file during run time.

## Software Requirements
MATLAB 2020 and above are required to run this code and model.
